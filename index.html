        <h2>Otterly Fun Facts!</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>The word otter derives from the Old English word otor or oter. This, and cognate words in other Indo-European languages,
            ultimately stem from the Proto-Indo-European language root *wódr̥, which also gave rise to the English word "water".</li>
            <li>An otter's den is called a holt or couch. Male otters are called dogs or boars, females are called bitches or sows, and their offspring are called pups.
            their offspring are called pups.</li>
            <li>The feces of otters are typically identified by their distinctive aroma, the smell of which has been described as
            ranging from freshly mown hay to putrefied fish; these are known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spraint">spraints</a>.</li>
            <li>Otters can be very rapey! &#129446;</li>
            <li> Their most striking anatomical features are the powerful webbed feet used to swim, and their seal-like abilities holding
            breath underwater.</li>
